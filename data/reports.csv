0;2.01.2004;"Daily News Review A quiet start to the year January 2, 2004 The NBP will today publish balance of payments data for Q3 2003 compiled on a payments basis. They will most likely confirm the main trends observed in Q3 in previously published NBP data on a payments basis and CSO statistics on a customs declaration basis, and should not affect the market. Deputy Finance Minister Ryszard Michalski said on Wednesday that the ministry had completed an operation to sell €200 million from a loan to Poland from the EIB on the market. The transaction helped the ministry enter the New Year with 7 billion zlotys of free funds in the budget account. This will facilitate the financing of high borrowing needs at the beginning of 2004. Hot News Today Quarterly Balance of Payments Data Today the NBP will publish data on the balance of payments on a transaction basis for the third quarter of 2003. Today at 4:00 pm, the NBP will publish quarterly balance of payments statistics for Q3 2003 (on a transaction basis). However, the data are not expected to bring any revelations. They will most likely confirm the main trends observed in Q3 in previously published NBP data on a payments basis and CSO statistics on a customs declaration basis. The data should not affect the financial market - first, because of the lethargic state of the market at the turn of the year, and second, because they will not change the overall assessment of the current economic situation. Conclusion: today's data will confirm the foreign trade trends indicated by previously published statistics, and should not affect the market. Information from the Ministry of Finance The MinFin has completed an operation to sell €200 million on the foreign exchange market .... which helped the ministry enter the New Year with a PLN 7 billion liquidity reserve Deputy Finance Minister Ryszard Michalski said on Wednesday that the Finance Ministry has completed the operation to sell €200 million from the EIB loan on the foreign exchange market, which began on December 19. This means that the ministry is no longer expected to be active on the foreign exchange market early this year. Michalski also said that the state of the budget's liquidity deposit at the end of the year should reach at least PLN 7 billion, which means that the ministry has met the plan in this regard. The revised plan for 2003 assumed that the balance of funds in the central budget's gold accounts would reach PLN 7.16 billion at the end of December. The achievement of this amount is positive news given that in September the budget's ""liquidity cushion"" had shrunk dramatically to a mere PLN 1.1 billion, raising concerns about the budget's loss of liquidity at the end of 2003. However, the last quarter saw an increase in the budget's free funds, which should make it easier Maciej Reluga Chief Economist Piotr Bielski (22) 586 8333 Piotr Bujak (22) 586 8341 Aleksander Krzyzaniak (22) 586 8342 (22) 586 8363 Email: imie.nazwisko@bzwbk.pl Daily Review of Events financing the government's borrowing needs in early 2004 and thus provide support for the debt market.

1;5.01.2004;Daily News Review This week only food prices January 5, 2004 This week only food price data for the second half of December will be released. We anticipate a 0.4% m/m increase, which will put December inflation at 1.7%. The Senate will begin work on the 2004 budget, but no significant changes to the main parameters of the budget are expected during this debate. The NBP's transaction-based balance of payments data confirmed the foreign trade trends observed in previously reported statistics (based on payments from the NBP and on customs declarations from the CSO). They confirmed strong growth in exports in the first three quarters of 2003, while imports also showed some signs of recovery. Hot events of the new week This week you can expect more activity in the financial market ... although there won't be much data We expect food prices to point to a rise in inflation in December to 1.7% y/y This year, the CSO will report the food price index only for the first half of the month The Senate will begin debate on the 2004 budget bill. The two-week holiday period has just ended, and this week should bring increased activity in the financial market. However, there won't be much new economic news. Only one data release is planned - on Wednesday (January 7) at 4:00 pm, the CSO will report food prices for the second half of December. We forecast growth at the same rate as in the first half of the month, i.e. 0.2% compared to the previous 15-day period, and 0.4% m/m. This will mean an acceleration in CPI growth to 1.7% y/y from 1.6% in November. We anticipate that the gradual rise in food prices will continue throughout the rest of 2004, or at least the first half of it, as trends in the second half of the year will depend on this year's harvest. Wednesday's food price data for the second half of December will be the last information of its kind this year. The CSO said that starting with data for January, no information on food prices in the second half of the month will be published. Preliminary data on the first half of the month will be released around the 25th of each month (except for the January data, which will be released on February 9). On Wednesday, the Senate will begin work on the 2004 budget bill. In our opinion, no significant changes in the shape of the budget should be expected during Senate work. Moreover, even if the SLD, which has an advantage in the upper house, passes significant amendments, the question remains whether they will be adopted later by the Diet. Conclusion: Food price data will be an important indication of the level of inflation at the end of 2003. We expect them to indicate an increase in CPI to 1.7% y/y in December. The Senate begins work on the 2004 budget, but no significant changes to the bill's parameters are expected.

As expected, the data yielded no surprises, confirming the trends outlined by previously published monthly data for the period (NBP data on a payments basis and CSO data on a customs statistics basis). The table below shows the main elements of the balance of payments on a transactions basis compared to the statistics on a payments basis.

There continued to be rapid growth in exports, and their dynamics were even faster than in previous quarters, to which the weakening zloty exchange rate may have contributed. At the same time, there was a rebound for imports against a much weaker performance in previous quarters, indicating an improvement in the dynamics of domestic demand. Foreign trade trends led to a narrowing of the trade deficit and were the main reason for the decline in the current account deficit. Events in the financial account of the balance of payments compiled on a transactions basis were also similar to those indicated by the data on a payments basis, namely the continuation of the decline in foreign direct investment inflows and the outflow of portfolio investment from the debt instruments market were evident in last year's Q3. Conclusion: nothing new - confirmation of positive trends in foreign trade indicated by previously published statistics and negative trends in the financial account of the balance of payments. No impact on the market. Market Monitor On Friday, the market was still in a holiday and New Year's mood. The zloty exchange rate fluctuated in a narrow range, and turnover was very low. Also in the Treasury securities market, trading was rather inactive. At today's tender, the Finance Ministry will offer 52-week Treasury bills with a nominal value of PLN 1 billion, 26-week papers worth PLN 200 million and 13-week papers for PLN 100 million. The ministry will also announce today the supply of two-year bonds on Wednesday. Conclusion: Normal activity will return to the market this week. 2 Daily News - International Review In December, economic activity in Eurozone industry increased for the fourth consecutive month, accelerating at a faster pace than in November but slower than analysts had expected. The Reuters PMI rose to 52.4 points, the highest level since January 2001, from 52.2 the previous month, while 53.0 points were forecast for December. For the fourth consecutive month, the index remained above the 50-point level, the line between deterioration and improvement in activity. Meanwhile, in the United States, the ISM index has already moved significantly away from this level, as economic activity in manufacturing grew rapidly and contrary to expectations. The ISM index reached 66.2 points in December, compared to 62.8 points in November and a forecast of 61.0 points. Preliminary estimates of December inflation in the eurozone and Italy will be released today. XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX
2;6.01.2004;"Daily News Review The government is meeting today January 6, 2004 At today's Cabinet meeting, the government is to discuss tax strategy, which includes a significant reduction in PIT rates (starting in 2007). The government will also continue discussing the so-called Hausner plan. By the end of the month, we should find out the SLD's support for this public finance reform plan. Prime Minister Miller's meeting with the SLD National Council, which was scheduled for today, was postponed because the prime minister had to remain in the hospital. President Aleksander Kwasniewski believes that due to his health condition, the prime minister should reflect on his ability to continue holding two important posts (head of government and head of the SLD). Hot news Will the government discuss tax strategy? The Finance Ministry is proposing PIT rates of 15% and 25% in 2007. During the first two years of the strategy's introduction, people with lower incomes would gain This month we should learn more about the SLD's support for the Hausner plan A schedule sent by the Government Information Center shows that the government will discuss the tax strategy at today's meeting. According to today's Rzeczpospolita, the strategy calls for lowering PIT rates to 15% and 25% (from 19%, 30% and 40%), which would be ""an alternative to the flat tax."" However, the first step (in 2005-2006) would only see a reduction in the tax-free amount and tax thresholds, while only the second step (in 2007) would involve a reduction in tax rates. This means that people with lower incomes would gain from the introduction of the new system in the first two years of its implementation, while taxpayers paying higher rates would only reap the tax benefits in 2007. During today's meeting, the government is also expected to be given an update on the debate over the Hausner plan, as usual. The final report will be presented on January 20, and the government is expected to adopt an executive plan for changes in public finances early on. Before that happens, the Hausner plan will be discussed at the SLD Supreme Council (probably on January 24). Conclusion: today, the government is expected to discuss a plan to significantly reduce PIT. By the end of January, we should find out what support there is for the Hausner plan. Candidates for the MPC will be questioned in the Sejm The trio proposed by the SLD-PSLUP (Czekaj, Nieckarz, Pietrewicz) has the best chance of being elected by the Sejm Today, the public finance committee will question six candidates for members of the Monetary Policy Council from the Sejm. As we wrote earlier, three have the best chance of being elected: Jan Czekaj (SLD candidate), Miroslaw Pietrewicz (PSL) and Stanislaw Nieckarz (UP). The three parties SLD, PSL and UP have reached an agreement that they will support each other's candidates in the vote, which in practice Maciej Reluga Chief Economist Piotr Bielski (22) 586 8333 Piotr Bujak (22) 586 8341 Aleksander Krzyzaniak (22) 586 8342 (22) 586 8363 Email: imie.nazwisko@bzwbk.pl The Daily Review of Events assures that all three are assured election by the Sejm. According to Rzeczpospolita, a vote on the matter is expected to take place in the Sejm on Thursday, January 8. Senate committee will interview MPC nominees next week A similar procedure will be followed next week by the Senate, which must select 3 out of 11 candidates. Certainly, the hearings and vote in the Senate will be much more interesting than those in the Sejm, since among those running for the MPC from the lower house of parliament are two of President Kwasniewski's economic advisors. Their election could change the distribution of forces in the new MPC, increasing the strength of a potential coalition of ""moderate doves"" against radical supporters of monetary easing. Candidate hearings and a vote are scheduled for next Wednesday, January 14. Conclusion: Parliament will elect new MPC members within 2 weeks.

This may be a good opportunity to provide summaries of the policies of the past few years, especially since President Kwasniewski will attend. Already this morning, NBP President Leszek Balcerowicz and Council member Dariusz Rosati gave interviews on Polish Radio. Balcerowicz said that inflation will rise to 2-3% in 2004 (from 1.7% in December 2003), but stressed that this will be partly due to the increase in indirect taxes associated with EU accession and budget problems. Rosati said that there is room for interest rate cuts this year, but that this is limited due to uncertainty over fiscal policy. This confirms that we can expect a further drop in rates after the adoption of the Hausner plan. Especially since the new Council will not include hawks like Boguslaw Grabowski, who said today that all factors predict no further rate cuts. Conclusion: the NBP president's statement indicates that the central bank expects inflation to remain under control, and this means that there will be room for rate cuts after the Hausner plan is adopted. Market Monitor Yesterday, trading was active and the holiday mood completely disappeared from the market. The zloty recorded a marked strengthening of about 1% against the dolareuro basket. In the government bond market, yields rose along the entire curve ahead of Wednesday's tender, but sentiment is positive enough that the ministry should have no problem selling the papers tomorrow. The Finance Ministry said yesterday that at the tender on Wednesday, the supply of OK0604 bonds, will amount to PLN 2.7 billion. According to earlier announcements, the ministry is expected to offer two-year bonds for PLN 7.5-9 billion in the first quarter, with PLN 2.5-3 billion at each auction. The first Treasury bill auction in 2004 was as successful as the last auction last year. With high demand, the Finance Ministry sold all the 52-week papers on offer, and their yields 2 Daily Review of Events registered a marked decline from the December 22 tender. All 26- and 13-week bills, which were offered after a long pause, were also sold. At next week's tender, Treasury bills will be offered the same as yesterday. Treasury bills worth PLN 5.3 billion will be offered at auctions in January, the same amount as in December. Conclusion: Yesterday, market activity was normal. Bond supply in line with earlier announcements and market expectations. International Review According to preliminary estimates, the annual inflation rate in the Eurozone eased to 2.1% in December from the 2.2% recorded in November. The data was in line with the market's forecast, and eurozone inflation remains above the ECB's inflation target of 2.0%. In Italy, preliminary estimates showed that consumer prices rose 0.1% m/m in December, while the annual inflation rate remained unchanged at the 2.5% recorded in November. Meanwhile, analysts' forecast based on data from Italy's 12 major cities was 0.0% and 2.4%, respectively. Today will see the publication of December economic activity indexes for the Eurozone (Reuters Services) and US (ISM non-manufacturing) service sectors. Also scheduled for today in the U.S. are publications on industrial orders for November. In addition, France will report revised GDP results for Q3 of this year.XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX"
3;7.01.2004;"Daily News Review ""Dove"" Senate candidates January 7, 2004 The Sejm recommended Jan Czekaj, Stanislaw Nieckarz and Miroslaw Pietrewicz as members of the MPC for the new term. SLD senators also recommended three doves (Marian Noga, Stanislaw Stec and Stanislaw Owsiak). Although one of them said that the new Council should start its term with a 100-bp rate cut, in our opinion the strategy of small steps will rather continue. To prevent radical doves from dominating the new MPC, Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner became involved in the selection of Council members. The deputy speaker of the Senate said yesterday that several rounds of voting should be expected next week, and it is still an open question who will be appointed to the MPC by the Senate. We forecast that food prices rose 0.4% m/m, putting inflation at 1.7% y/y in December. The government discussed its tax strategy yesterday, but did not provide much detail. The Finance Minister said that lowering the tax rate to 15% and 25%, as reported in Rzeczpospolita, is only one of the proposals. One thing is certain - first the government must reduce spending. Prime Minister Leszek Miller has rejected the possibility of resigning from one of his posts (head of the government and chairman of the SLD). Hot News Today Food Price Data We expect food prices to point to 1.7% inflation in December This year the CSO will only report data for the first half of the month The only data release of the week is scheduled for today - at 4pm the CSO will report food prices for the second half of December. We forecast growth at the same rate as in the first half of the month, i.e. 0.2% from the previous 15-day period and 0.4% m/m. This will mean an acceleration in CPI growth to 1.7% y/y from 1.6% in November. We anticipate that the gradual rise in food prices will continue in 2004, or at least in its first half, as trends in the second half of the year will depend on this year's harvest. Food price data for the second half of December 2003 will be the last of its kind. The CSO said that starting with data for January 2004, no information on food prices in the second half of the month will be published. Preliminary data on the first half of the month will be released around the 25th of each month (except for the January data, which will be released on February 9). Conclusion: food price data will provide an important clue as to inflation at the end of 2003. We expect CPI in December at 1.7% y/y. Farewell to old MPC, dovish dominance in new Council Official farewell to eight MPC members The farewell meeting with the old MPC was held yesterday. As expected, it was an opportunity to express opinions on monetary policy in the past and future. President Aleksander Kwasniewski said that regardless of doubts and discussions about the MPC's policy, the Council managed to Maciej Reluga Chief Economist Piotr Bielski (22) 586 8333 Piotr Bujak (22) 586 8341 Aleksander Krzyzaniak (22) 586 8342 (22) 586 8363 Email: imie.nazwisko@bzwbk.pl Daily News Review President Kwasniewski reiterated his support for central bank independence ... and Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner shared his opinion The trio proposed by the SLD (Czekaj, Nieckarz, Pietrewicz) will be elected by the Sejm The choice of candidates in the Senate is more interesting SLD senators backed three strong doves .... one of whom suggested a 100bp cut to start, but such a proposal is unlikely to get a majority Deputy Prime Minister Hausner was involved in the selection of new MPC members ... to avoid the predominance of doves to lower inflation and prove that the zloty can be a strong currency. He also expressed hopes that the new Council would maintain the ""prestige and credibility"" earned by the outgoing central bankers. Kwasniewski strongly supported the independence of the central bank, stating that he has always stood and will continue to stand for maintaining the bank's independence. Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Jerzy Hausner shared the president's opinion, adding that it would be crucial for the new MPC to promote economic growth without threatening price stability. NBP President Leszek Balcerowicz reiterated that the mission of the new MPC will be to defend the price stability achieved by the previous team. However, there were also differing positions on monetary policy. MPC candidate Stanislaw Nieckarz said that real interest rates in Poland should be the same as in the EU, that is, in his opinion, at around 1%. Interestingly, he also said that he knows of no other central bank whose sole purpose would be price stability, and that the central bank's task must also be to support economic activity. Another candidate for a seat on the MPC, Miroslaw Pietrewicz, said that the goal of coordination between fiscal and monetary policy should be to achieve the overarching goal of rapid economic growth. Nieckarz and Pietrewicz, as well as Jan Czekaj, were recommended yesterday by the parliamentary Committee on Public Finance as MPC members. The three other candidates (from the opposition) received a negative recommendation. The Sejm will elect new members, most likely agreeing with the recommendation this week (Thursday). The Deputy Senate Speaker said yesterday that the SLD had recommended Marian Noga, Stanislaw Owsiak and Stanislaw Stec as Senate members of the MPC. One of them, Stanislaw Stec, expressed the opinion that the MPC ""should abandon the pointless policy of small steps and start the new term with a 100bp rate cut, and then see how the situation develops."" The two other SLD candidates are likely to have similar views on the subject. This suggests that if these three dovish candidates receive the support of a majority of senators, the six radical MPC members appointed by both houses of parliament will have a clear majority on the MPC. In such a situation, it would be obvious that the monetary easing cycle would continue. Worse, it could be a loosening on a dangerous scale. Fortunately, Jan Czekaj has repeatedly said that the tactic of small steps should continue when it comes to interest rate changes. According to Gazeta Wyborcza, in order to prevent radical doves from dominating the new MPC, Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner was involved in selecting candidates. This is why two advisors to President Kwasniewski (Edmund Pietrzak, Andrzej Wojtyna) were among the Senate candidates. If at least one of them had been elected, the balance of votes in the new MPC would have been preserved. According to what the Deputy Speaker of the Senate said yesterday, several rounds of voting can be expected next week, and it is still an open question who will be appointed to the MPC by the Senate. This will be crucial for the financial market. Conclusion: After yesterday's decisions by the SLD senators, it seems likely that strong doves will have a majority on the new MPC, reinforcing expectations for further interest rate cuts this year after the Hausner plan is approved. 2 Daily Review of Events Slightly lower than planned budget deficit in 2003. Budget deficit lower than planned in 2003 ... but deficit of entire public finance sector not necessarily lower The government faces a much tougher challenge - fiscal policy in 2004 and beyond Today in the Senate, the start of the debate on the draft budget ... but don't expect major changes Wasilewska-Trenkner - Q1. 04 will be very difficult, but there is no threat of budget default Michalski - the ministry's intention is to offer bonds with longer maturities as soon as the market situation improves Deputy Finance Minister Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner said yesterday that the 2003 budget deficit was lower than assumed in the budget law (38.7 billion zlotys), but added that it was not known by how much for the time being. Such information, together with the news of high budget liquidity at the end of December (the ministry managed to reach PLN 7 billion in liquidity deposits), indicates that the central budget in 2003 was not out of control. This may have the effect of alleviating to some extent investors' concerns about the condition of Poland's public finances and improving sentiment ahead of large Treasury paper issues in early 2004. Unfortunately, the success in implementing the 2003 budget was to some extent apparent, as revenue shortfalls with high spending were pushed outside the central budget, leading to a widening of the deficit in the entire public finance sector. Be that as it may, 2003 is in the past, and now the government faces much more serious challenges - the budget for 2004 and beyond. From this point of view, last year's budget can be considered a failure. As for the fiscal policy planned for 2004, today the Senate will begin work on the budget bill for next year adopted in late December by the Sejm. In our opinion, no significant changes in the shape of the budget are expected during the Senate debates. Moreover, even if the SLD senators, who hold a majority in the Senate, decide to make significant changes to the parameters of the budget, it is doubtful that they will later be approved by the lower house (after the debate in the Senate, the budget bill works its way to the Sejm and MPs may reject the amendments made by the senators) during the session scheduled for January 20-23. All in all, we do not expect the parliament to make a noticeable reduction in the budget deficit assumed for this one (PLN 45.3 billion). Before the 2004 budget is finally signed by the president it is being implemented according to the government draft. Borrowing needs this year are at a record high, and the first quarter of the year is a period of particularly high supply of Treasury securities. Deputy Minister Wasilewska-Trenkner said it will be a very difficult quarter, but in her opinion there is absolutely no threat to budget solvency. Another deputy finance minister, Ryszard Michalski, is quietly confident of success. He said yesterday that he sees signs of increased demand for Treasury bonds, adding that he hopes today's auction will signal positive developments. He declared that when the market situation improves, the Finance Ministry intends to return to offering more Treasury securities with longer maturities. He also said that over the course of this year he expects the zloty's exchange rate to stabilize and even strengthen, in line with the assumptions adopted in the 2004 budget law. Well, the Finance Ministry may have many wishes, but they will not come true if the government fails to implement the Hausner plan. Nonetheless, the fact is that market sentiment actually seems to be slightly better at the moment, and today's bond auction should be successful. Conclusion: the 2003 budget deficit was lower than planned, but fiscal problems remain unresolved, which is a major risk factor for the market this year. The Senate will begin work on the 2004 budget bill today, but no significant changes in budget parameters are expected. 3 Daily News - an overview of events Market Monitor Gold quotes (6.01.2004) Min Max USD 3.6500 3.6850 EUR 4.6630 4.6975 Fixing 3.6707 4.6704 Exchange rates (today's opening) EURUSD CADPLN 1.2728 USDPLN DKKPLN 3.6563 EURPLN NOKPLN 4,6535 CHFPLN SEKPLN 2.9681 JPYPLN* CZKPLN 3.4420 GBPPLN HUFPLN* 6.6686 * 100 units 2.8436 0.6247 0.5444 0.5108 0.1438 1.7888 Secondary market yields (6.01.2004) Bills Yield Change (bps) 3M 5.35 0 6M 5.50 -25 9M 5.73 -2 12M 5.70 -10 Bonds Yield Change (bps) 2L 6.23 -7 3L 6.37 -8 4L 6.49 -11 5L 6.67 -7 8L 6.67 -10 10L 6.60 -5 20L 6.55 -5 WIBOR Rates (6.01.2004) Term Rates O/N 4.78 T/N 4.88 SW 5.19 2W 5.28 1M 5.32 3M 5.49 6M 5.57 9M 5.65 1Y 5.69 Change (bps) -30 -28 -7 -2 -2 -1 -3 -2 -3 Yesterday, the appreciation of the zloty continued with demand from foreign institutions.

International overview In December, economic activity in the Eurozone's services sector grew at a slower pace than in November, while analysts expected further acceleration. The Reuters Services index fell to 56.6 points from 57.5 points in November, while a rise to 57.8 points was forecast. Also in the United States, activity in the service sector slowed, contrary to forecasts. The ISM Non-manufacturing index fell to 58.6 points in December, compared to 60.1 points in November and an expected 61.3 points. However, the indexes still remain clearly above 50 points, the line between deterioration and improvement in activity. In the United States, data on industrial orders were roughly in line with market forecasts. They fell sharply by 1.4% m/m in November, following a 2.5% increase in October (revised from 2.2%). Analysts' average forecast was -1.5%. Today, the European Commission will present December's economic sentiment and business climate indicators for the eurozone. XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX"
4;8.01.2004;"Daily News Review 2003 inflation no higher than 1.7% January 8, 2004 Food prices in the second half of December rose less than expected. However, we estimate that the inflation rate increased in December to 1.7% y/y from 1.6% in November. This was largely due to the low-base effect of alcoholic beverage and fuel prices. Today, the Diet will likely elect three new MPC members. There should be no surprises - the sure candidates are Jan Czekaj, Miroslaw Pietrewicz and Stanislaw Nieckarz. Meanwhile, the Senate yesterday questioned its candidates for the Council and, interestingly, all eleven contenders received positive recommendations. This does not make it easy to guess who will be nominated to the MPC from the upper house. The Senate vote is scheduled for next week, January 14. Hot news Food prices rose less than expected Food price growth below expectations Still no sign of negative impact of summer drought Inflation rose in December ... due to low base effect Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices in the second half of December rose 0.1% from the first half of the month and 0.2% m/m. The increase was lower than our prediction and the market forecast of 0.4% m/m. It was mainly due to a 5.4% m/m increase in vegetable prices. Once again, some growth also occurred in the ""milk, cheese and eggs"" category. Prices of most other food items recorded moderate declines. Food prices, after excluding fruits and vegetables, fell by 0.2% m/m. The negative impact of low agricultural production over the past year still has not become apparent. Although food market analysts warned that there could be a sharp increase in the prices of grain products at the turn of the year, the CSO data did not confirm this - the prices of bread and cereal products rose by just 0.2% m/m. Despite a lower-than-expected rise in food prices in December (by 0.3% m/m on average), we expect the CPI to rise slightly to 1.7% y/y at the end of 2003, compared to 1.6% y/y in November. This will be due to the low-base effect on some components of the CPI, namely alcohol and fuel prices, which recorded declines in December 2002, while they rose slightly in December 2003. Also, the Finance Ministry estimates that inflation at the end of last year was 1.6%-1.7%. Conclusion: despite only a slight increase in food prices at the end of 2003, the inflation rate in December most likely rose to 1.7% y/y.

Of course, all the offered securities were sold, and the average yield was nearly 1 percentage point lower than at the tender in December and about 0.1 percentage point below the secondary market quotation on Tuesday. A supplementary auction will be held today, at which PLN 500 million worth of securities will be offered. Conclusion: very active trading and positive market trends yesterday. International Review The Eurozone Economic Sentiment Index, calculated by the European Commission, fell to 95.6 points in December from 96.0 points (revised from 95.9 points) in November. The index was well below the market's forecast of 96.1 points, and the decline was due to a deterioration in business sentiment, while consumer sentiment remained unchanged. In a separate report, the Commission said that the index of industrial activity declined to 0.01 points in December, down from 0.05 points (revised from 0.02 points) in November. The index turned positive for the second month in a row. The European Central Bank Council will meet today. Analysts expect no change in interest rates in the Eurozone and the refinancing rate should remain at 2.0%, set at last June's meeting. The decision will be announced at 1:45 p.m. In addition, the Eurozone will release data on producer prices and the unemployment rate in November. In Germany, meanwhile, unemployment data for December will be published. XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX"
5;9.01.2004;Daily News Review The composition of the MPC is still unknown January 9, 2004 As expected, the lower house of parliament yesterday appointed Jan Czeczek, Miroslaw Pietrewicz and Stanislaw Nieckarz as members of the new MPC. It is still very uncertain who will be nominated from the Senate. While SLD senators recommended three doves (Marian Noga, Stanislaw Stec and Stanislaw Owsiak), Deputy Prime Minister Hausner expressed support for Deputy Finance Minister Halina Wasilewska-Trenker, Professor Stanislaw Owsiak and two economic advisors to the president (Edmund Pietrzak and Andrzej Wojtyna). According to the Senate Speaker, Marian Noga is the strongest candidate. As we wrote yesterday, divergent opinions on the nominations make it difficult to predict who will ultimately be appointed by the Senate next week. Either way, it seems that the financial market has begun to think seriously (quite rightly) about further interest rate cuts. Hot news The parliament elected MPC members, the Senate votes next week No surprises in the Sejm - three new MPC members were elected ... but the Senate's choice remains a big unknown One thing is certain - the opposition's candidate has no chance The deputy finance minister won the government's support The parliament appointed three candidates to the new MPC yesterday. As expected, MPs appointed Jan Czekaj, Stanislaw Nieckarz and Miroslaw Pietrewicz (we have already presented their profiles several times), i.e. as envisaged by the agreement reached between the SLD, UP and PSL. The outcome of the vote in the Senate (expected on January 14) is much less of a foregone conclusion than it was in the Sejm. In Wednesday's Daily News, we wrote that the SLD - which has an outright majority in the upper house of parliament - had recommended three doves, Marian Noga, Stanislaw Stec and Stanislaw Owsiak, as members of the MPC from the Senate. We noted, however, that it was not certain that it was these three nominees who would receive an appointment. Our doubts were confirmed on Wednesday by the chairman of the Senate Committee on Economy and Finance, Jerzy Markowski, who said that senators could support candidates other than those recommended by the SLD, especially since the vote will be secret and party discipline will not be in effect during it. In addition, the Economy and Finance Committee has positively recommended all eleven candidates, even opposition candidate Waldemar Kuczynski. What's more, the Senate Speaker said yesterday that the senators will meet again on Monday evening and it is possible that they will revise the recommendation. Since this will take place just two days before the final vote, it is very likely that the senators will no longer change their minds and the people who will be recommended on Monday will actually be elected on Wednesday. A recent candidate who has been strongly supported is Deputy Finance Minister Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner. She has made very few statements on monetary policy in the past, but Finance Minister Andrzej Raczko has given in Maciej Reluga Chief Economist Piotr Bielski (22) 586 8333 Piotr Bujak (22) 586 8341 Aleksander Krzyzaniak (22) 586 8342 (22) 586 8363 Email: imie.nazwisko@bzwbk.pl Daily News Review The deputy prime minister also endorses the president's advisors According to the deputy speaker of the Senate, Noga has the best chance of being elected Noga presents strongly dovish views on interest rates .... and rather strange views on exchange rate policy Wednesday hinted at the likely attitude of his deputy, while strongly recommending her candidacy. Namely, Raczko said that Wasilewska-Trenkner, as a member of the MPC, would be a guarantor of good relations between the two sides of Swietokrzyska Street (where the MinFin and the NBP are headquartered), adding that at the current low level of inflation, the MPC should support the government's pro-growth economic policy. Raczko even went so far as to say that otherwise the conflict between the Ministry of Finance and the NBP would be even sharper than in the past. Yesterday, WasilewskaTrenkner's candidacy also received an unequivocal recommendation from Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner. However, he also backed Professor Stanislaw Owsiak and two of the president's economic advisors (Edmund Pietrzak and Andrzej Wojtyna). According to the Deputy Speaker of the Senate, the strongest candidate from the upper house is Marian Noga. On Wednesday, Noga said the MPC could cut interest rates as early as February, and the total cut this year could be 100 bps. Nevertheless, he advocates small, gradual reductions spread out over time. In his view, the MPC's overriding goal should be to keep inflation below 2%. Contrary to market expectations, he believes that in 2004 both average inflation and year-end inflation will be below this level. However, Noga sees some risks. He believes that the critical months will be March, April and June, when the pre-harvest season begins and Poland joins the EU - during this period, according to Noga, inflation could reach 2%. Noga also said that the new MPC will have to focus on preparing the Polish banking system to absorb funds from the EU once Poland joins the community in May and later the eurozone. In his opinion, Poland will be ready to adopt the single currency in 2008 if the fiscal reforms prepared by Minister Hausner are implemented and the deficit is limited below 3% of GDP in 2007. Noga believes that Poland should maintain a fully floating exchange rate of the zloty until it enters the ERM-2 system. Interestingly, he believes that it would be beneficial for our country to narrow the allowable band of fluctuation in this system to +/- 10%, because there is nothing better for Polish entrepreneurs than a predictable economic situation when producers and exporters know that exchange rate volatility will not be too high. Well, if that's the case, why doesn't Noga propose changing the exchange rate regime today? Conclusion: we will find out in a few days whether doves will dominate the new MPC. Market Monitor Yesterday the zloty fluctuated with fairly active trading. Most of the changes were triggered by the movement of the EURUSD exchange rate. Initially, as the correction in that market continued, there was demand for the Polish currency and it strengthened. As soon as the trend in the EURUSD market reversed, sentiment towards the zloty changed and selling prevailed. Foreign investors were very active yesterday. The Treasury securities market saw further marked strengthening, as the positive sentiment from Wednesday was maintained. 2 Daily Review of Events Listings of the zloty (8.01.2004) Min Max USD 3, 6690 3.7105 EUR 4.6520 4.7050 Fixing 3.7078 4.6634 Exchange rates (today's opening) EURUSD CADPLN 1.2737 USDPLN DKKPLN 3.6875 EURPLN NOKPLN 4,6968 CHFPLN SEKPLN 2.9978 JPYPLN* CZKPLN 3.4458 GBPPLN HUFPLN* 6.7538 * 100 units 2.8818 0.6306 0.5421 0.5156 0.1450 1.7580 Treasury bond auction (8.Jan.2004) Supply Demand Sales Average annuity.

Very high demand was reported, as the price from the first auction was lower than the current level in the market, and all the offered securities were sold. A representative of the Finance Ministry said yesterday that at the January 14 auction, the supply of 3- and 7-year floating coupon bonds will exceed PLN 1 billion, but will not be as large as the supply of 2-year bonds last Wednesday (PLN 2.7 billion). This will be the first auction of these papers ever. Besides, yesterday Poland sold €1.5 billion worth of 5-year Eurobonds at a yield 32 bps above the swap rate and 46 bps above German bonds. The value of the issue was raised from the initially planned €1 billion. Fitch Ratings gave the issue a BBB+ rating. The Finance Minister said the ministry is considering another issue for the non-European market in the first quarter of this year, but it has not yet been decided whether the bonds will be dollar-denominated or yen-denominated. Conclusion: Demand for Polish bonds is holding up, probably until the market sees fiscal policy concerns again. The currency market will mainly follow EURUSD fluctuations. International Review As expected, the European Central Bank Council did not change interest rates at yesterday's meeting. The main interest rate in the eurozone, the refinancing rate, has been at 2.0% since June 2003. At a press conference, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said that the recent strengthening of the euro has been detrimental to exports from eurozone countries, but that this effect could be partially offset by rising demand in the global economy. In line with market expectations, interest rates will be raised only when the Fed decides to raise rates in the US. In December, Germany's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate declined to 10.4% from the 10.5% recorded in November, while the market forecast was for an unchanged rate. In addition, for the fourth consecutive month, the adjusted number of unemployed recorded a decline, this time by 21,000 people. The unadjusted number of unemployed rose in December, but at a slower pace than in this month in the past few years. The unemployment rate in the eurozone stood at 8.8% in November, unchanged from September's data, marking the sixth consecutive month of stable unemployment. The result was in line with analysts' expectations. Unemployment was highest in Spain (11.3%). Eurozone producer price data were more or less in line with the market forecast. Prices rose by 0.1% m/m in November, and annual price growth was 1.4%, compared to 0.9.% in October. Analysts' forecasts were for 0.0% and 1.2%, respectively. Today in the United States, the December unemployment report will be published. The unemployment rate is expected at 5.9%, unchanged from November. In the Eurozone, October retail sales data will also be reported. 3 Daily News - news review XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX
6;12.01.2004;"Daily News Review Will the Senate change its recommendation? January 12, 2004 This week the Senate will appoint three new MPC members. Recently, President Kwasniewski and members of the government joined the debate on the choice of candidates, so it is possible that among the chosen three, along with Marian Noga and Stanislaw Owsiak, there will be one moderate (Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner). Either way, interest rate cuts in the coming months seem inevitable - we expect two-three reductions of 25 bps each in the first half of this year. Statistical data for December, which will be released this week, should be in line with investors' expectations and neutral for the market. We expect an acceleration in money supply growth, which is normal with rising inflation and a recovering economy. We estimate that the inflation rate rose slightly in December to 1.7% from 1.6% in November. Employment and wages are not expected to show significant changes in the trend and economic situation. Hot events of the new week The Senate will elect three MPC members on Wednesday ... but today SLD senators may change their recommendations President Kwasniewski and government representatives very active in the debate on the election of new MPC members ... pointing out that new Council members should not be elected from among parliamentarians This week we will know three new members of the Monetary Policy Council nominated by the Senate. A vote on the matter is scheduled for Wednesday, January 14. However, it is possible that more information on the likely selection of senators will emerge today, as the SLD club is expected to make a final decision in the evening on which candidates it will support. This will be an important announcement, given the SLD's overwhelming majority in the upper house of parliament. Last week, the presidium of the SLD club supported three candidates for the position of MPC member: SLD Senator Marian Noga, Professor Stanislaw Owsiak and SLD MP Stanislaw Stec. However, according to the party's representatives, the recommendations may yet change. Notably, the government and President Aleksander Kwasniewski joined the discussion on the shape of the MPC, urging senators to make a prudent choice. Kwasniewski suggested that the new MPC members should not be chosen from among MPs and senators, thus disavowing the candidacies of Marian Noga and Stanislaw Stec. As we wrote earlier, Marian Noga nevertheless seems to have the best chance of being elected to the new Council from the Senate, which was recently confirmed by representatives of the upper house of parliament. He seems to have managed to win the support of a broad group of deputies. Stanislaw Owsiak also appears to be a very strong candidate, especially given recent statements by the government and the president. He is not a politician, but an independent economist working at a university, and besides, his candidacy has been strongly supported by Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner. The biggest doubts concern Stanislaw Stec, SLD deputy and vice-chairman of the parliamentary public finance committee. He recently declared himself a very firm dove, stating that the new MPC should start with a 100bp rate cut. Our guess is that in order to keep a balance of votes between the less and more radical MPC members, the president and Maciej Reluga Chief Economist Piotr Bielski (22) 586 8333 Piotr Bujak (22) 586 8341 Aleksander Krzyzaniak (22) 586 8342 (22) 586 8363 Email: imie.nazwisko@bzwbk.pl Daily News Review Can the deputy finance minister compromise? We expect two-three rate cuts (25 bps each) in the first half of this year. This week, the Senate will also vote on this year's budget ... a gentle (slight) deficit reduction is possible Publication of the money supply on Wednesday Acceleration of nominal growth rates of monetary aggregates is normal with rising inflation and economic recovery government representatives will try to convince senators to replace this appointment with someone less radical. While the president's economic advisors (Andrzej Wojtyna and Edmund Pietrzak) may prove difficult for the Senate to accept, we think that the selection of Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner (recently supported by Andrzej Raczko and Jerzy Hausner) may be a viable compromise. The Senate's decision on this third MPC member may turn out to be crucial to the outlook for the future of interest rates in Poland, and as a result, the financial market will eagerly await the outcome of the discussion of the issue and the vote. If the aforementioned scenario comes true and Wasilewska-Trenkner joins the MPC, the distribution of radical and cautious doves in the new Council will be more or less even. This would be consistent with our scenario of two-three interest rate cuts (each by 25 bps) in the first half of this year. Otherwise, particularly if Stanislaw Stec gains the Senate nomination, along with Marian Noga and Stanislaw Owsiak, one should expect monetary expansion in the following months to be much deeper, perhaps too deep, although we would not expect a departure from the so-called ""small steps"" strategy. Before deciding on the composition of the MPC, the Senate is likely to complete its work on the 2004 budget. Recall that the final version of the budget is not expected to differ very much from the draft prepared by the government. Although the Senators have prepared amendments aimed at reducing the hole in the budget by another PLN 100 million (over and above the PLN 200 million reduction adopted by the Sejm), this is not a significant advance compared to the total scale of the fiscal imbalance of PLN 45.5 billion. In particular, the changes made by the Senate will not noticeably reduce the risk of the public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding safety levels. The final vote on the budget bill is expected on Tuesday. Starting Wednesday, the publication of December statistics will begin. The first to be released will be monetary statistics, published by the central bank on Wednesday at 4:00 p.m. We estimate that growth in total money supply (M3) remained unchanged at 5.6% y/y. As in November, we expect a significant decline in the ""other components of M3,"" mainly due to the expiration of bank bonds that households purchased a year ago to avoid capital gains tax. On the other hand, the growth rate of household deposits and cash in circulation should accelerate (the latter will reach almost 21% y/y in December). On the receivables side of the banking system, the gradual recovery in loan demand is expected to continue (total loan growth of 8.7% y/y vs. 8.5% in November), owed primarily to rising household loans. Overall, the data should not surprise, sustaining the trends seen in the previous month. The acceleration of growth in monetary aggregates is not surprising, given the rising inflation rate and reviving economic activity in Polish industry. Still, it is not necessarily a significant threat to the inflation outlook. 2 Daily News - an overview of events On Thursday, the inflation rate ... expected to rise to 1.7% y/y Budget execution for 2003 may also be reported this week ... although the state budget deficit may be lower this will be more than covered by the higher total public finance deficit In December, wages up 4.0% y/y ... and employment will fall again (by 3.4% y/y) On Thursday, the Central Statistical Office (CSO) will publish information on the growth of consumer prices. Following the release of preliminary data on a moderate increase in food prices in December (about 0.3% m/m), we estimate that the CPI inflation rate rose slightly to 1.7% y/y from 1.6% in November, which is at the same time in line with the market consensus. We have already written that this will be mainly due to the negative impact of a low statistical base for alcohol and fuel prices, which fell in December 2002, while they probably recorded slight increases in December 2003. Prices of other goods and services should remain almost stable. The data will be neutral for the market and for the outlook for monetary policy. It is also possible that the Finance Ministry will publish preliminary data on budget execution in December 2003 on Thursday (this has been suggested by a Finance Ministry official). Recent statements by Deputy Finance Minister Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner suggest that the data will be quite positive, showing that the deficit was slightly lower throughout the year than the planned PLN 38.7 billion. It should be remembered, however, that while the central budget deficit came within the target amount, the deficit of the entire public finance sector and the public debt were higher than expected in 2003, as a large part of budget spending was ""pushed"" outside the central budget. The presentation of this week's budget data is uncertain, as in the past, data for the last month of the year usually appeared with some delay (compared to the standard deadline of mid-month). At the end of the week, on Friday afternoon, the CSO will release data on employment and wages in the business sector in December. Again, these data should not show significant changes in the economic situation. We forecast that wage growth will be 4% y/y (vs. 4.1% in November), while employment will most likely record a 3.4% y/y decline (after a 3.3% y/y drop in November). Capacity utilization at Polish companies is still insufficient to increase demand for labor, which in turn is holding back wage pressure on prices. What's more, recent business survey results have shown that companies are announcing an increase in the scale of job cuts in the coming months. As long as we have this situation, there is no need to worry about excessive growth in consumer demand, which could threaten the MPC's inflation target. Conclusion: the issue of new MPC members from the Senate is very important for the market. We expect that in addition to Marian Noga and Stanislaw Owsiak, one of the moderate candidates (Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner) may be elected. Either way, interest rate cuts this year seem inevitable. The data published this week should be neutral for the market, confirming investors' expectations. 3 Daily News - an overview of events Market Monitor Gold quotes (9.01.2004) Min Max USD 3.6500 3.7010 EUR 4.6850 4.7070 Fixing 3.6845 4.6913 Exchange rates (today's opening) EURUSD CADPLN 1.2854 USDPLN DKKPLN 3.6515 EURPLN NOKPLN 4,6936 CHFPLN SEKPLN 2.9943 JPYPLN* CZKPLN 3.4304 GBPPLN HUFPLN* 6.7507 * 100 units 2.8729 0.6303 0.5430 0.5148 0.1439 1.7450 Secondary market yields (9.01.2004) Bills Yield Change (bps) 3M 5.25 +5 6M 5.40 +10 9M 5.40 +2 12M 5.35 -5 Bonds Yield Change (bps) 2L 5.86 -4 3L 5.90 -5 4L 6.10 -5 5L 6.27 -8 8L 6.45 0 10L 6.37 +2 20L 6.45 0 WIBOR Rates (9.01.2004) Term Rates O/N 5.41 T/N 5.41 SW 5.41 2W 5.41 1M 5.41 3M 5.43 6M 5.45 9M 5.46 1Y 5.48 Change (bps) +88 +30 +15 +11 +9 +4 0 0 +1 On Friday, the zloty fluctuated with fairly active trading, with most of the changes being triggered by EURUSD fluctuations.

The number of jobs in the economy increased for the fifth consecutive month, but this time it flooded by a thousand, well below expectations at 130,000, and this result was negatively received by the market. In the Eurozone, retail sales data were more or less in line with the market's forecast. Sales rose 0.5% m/m in October and were unchanged year-on-year, compared to forecasts of 0.4% and -0.2%, respectively. XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX"
7;13.01.2004;Daily News Review No recommendation in the Senate January 13, 2004 SLD senators decided yesterday not to give a recommendation to any of the MPC candidates. A week ago, Marian Noga, Stanislaw Owsiak and Stanislaw Stec had received recommendations. However, after the Senate Committee on Economy and Public Finance decided to give positive recommendations to all eleven candidates, the SLD club changed its mind. A secret vote (without party discipline) on all eleven candidates will be held tomorrow. An absolute majority of votes is required to elect a candidate. Hot news The government will deal with indexation of social benefits The government will today discuss changes to indexation of pensions ... which could save PLN 1.3 billion in this year's budget The final phase of the debate on the Hausner plan According to Gazeta Wyborcza, today the government is to deal with a proposal to change the indexation system for pensions, part of a program of savings in public finances developed by Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner. Currently, pensions are subject to indexation every March, with their increase determined by the previous year's inflation plus 20% of the average wage increase in the business sector. However, after applying Hausner's proposal, indexation of benefits would be slower, as it would occur only when the cumulative inflation rate since the last indexation exceeds 5% (but no less frequently than every three years). If these changes were implemented immediately, the government would save about PLN 1.3 billion in this year's budget expenditures. This is why the Council of Ministers intends to vote on this proposal as soon as possible, and certainly before March (when the indexation takes place). It is hoped that this proposal will find support in the government and parliament, as it will be an indication of the initial political support for the entire Hausner program. Today at 4pm, Deputy Prime Minister Hausner will meet with a group of experts to summarize the last two months of public debate on the rationalization of public spending. Conclusion: a change in the pension indexation system would be positive for the budget and the financial market. ... and the Senate is still working on the budget The Senate will pass a budget bill ...a slight reduction in the deficit is possible Today the Senate will return to work on the 2004 budget. The final version of the budget is not expected to differ very much from the draft prepared by the government. Although the senators have prepared amendments aimed at reducing the hole in the budget by another PLN 100 million (over and above the PLN 200 million reduction adopted by the Sejm), this is not significant progress compared to the total scale of the fiscal imbalance of PLN 45.5 billion.

Yesterday before noon, currency market activity was low, and in the afternoon the zloty weakened slightly against the dollar in the wake of the EURUSD, which rebounded from its earlier record high near 1.29 to around 1.28 in the late afternoon. The Treasury securities market also saw some weakening. The Ministry of Finance announced yesterday that at a tender on Wednesday, the total supply of 3-year WZ0307 and 7-year WZ0911 bonds will amount to PLN 1.5 billion. This will be the first issue of a new type of floating rate bonds. At yesterday's Treasury bill auction, the Finance Ministry sold all the offered securities. The supply of bills was at the same level as a week ago, while demand from investors was noticeably higher, especially for 26- and 13-week papers. Yields on all types of bills recorded marked declines. The tender in a week's time will offer 52-week Treasury bills with a nominal value of PLN 1 billion (against PLN 1.2 billion scheduled at the beginning of the month), 26-week papers worth PLN 100 million and 13-week papers for PLN 100 million. Conclusion: slight weakening at the beginning of the week. International Review Today, France will release preliminary inflation data and industrial production data for November.

8;14.01.2004;"Daily News Review Senators will vote today January 14, 2004 Senators will elect three MPC members today. The most controversial of the candidates, SLD MP Stanislaw Stec, withdrew his candidacy yesterday. According to Senate representatives, Stanislaw Owsiak and Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner have the best chance of being elected. Marian Noga is also a popular candidate among left-wing senators. If these three get the Senate's nomination, the group of radical doves is unlikely to dominate the new MPC, since NBP Chairman Leszek Balcerowicz will be able to count on a coalition with three members appointed by the president (names still unknown) and one or two people from parliament. If, in addition, one of the president's economic advisors will be on the MPC in place of Noga, the risk of excessive monetary easing will actually be much lower than might have been feared until recently. Which does not change the fact that we will most likely still see cautious interest rate cuts this year. The government has decided to postpone the change in the way pensions are indexed, which means that the promised reduction in this year's budget deficit (by PLN 1.3-1.4 billion) has become very doubtful. This is the first failure to implement Hausner's fiscal austerity program, which is undoubtedly negative news for the long end of the yield curve. Hot news Today selection of three new MPC members President Kwasniewski and several government officials are trying to avoid a majority of radical doves on the MPC Owsiak and Wasilewska-Trenkner have the best chance of nomination Today the Senate will select three members of the Monetary Policy Council. After a very heated discussion on the subject inside the Democratic Left Alliance, the decision of the upper house of parliament remains a great unknown and will be eagerly awaited by financial market analysts and economists. Apparently, President Aleksander Kwasniewski and some government officials tried very hard to prevent the scenario of the new MPC being dominated by people with very radical, dovish views. The president appealed to senators yesterday not to elect any person currently holding a deputy or senator seat to the Council. In practice, this would greatly narrow the field of choice, since as many as four of the eleven candidates sit either in the Senate (Genowefa Ferenc, Tadeusz Wnuk, Marian Noga) or in the Sejm (Stanislaw Stec). Excluding these nominees would leave very little room for maneuver for SLD senators, especially if they wanted to avoid electing either of the two opposition candidates (Stefan Krajewski and Waldemar Kuczynski). In practice, this would mean a much higher chance that the Senate would choose one of President Kwasniewski's economic advisors - Edmund Pietrzak or Andrzej Wojtyna. Pressure from the president and the government resulted in the resignation of one of the candidates last night - Stanislaw Stec resigned to run for the MPC. According to Deputy Senate Speaker Ryszard Jarzembowski, the highest chances of being elected are Professor Stanislaw Owsiak, Academy Professor Maciej Reluga Chief Economist Piotr Bielski (22) 586 8333 Piotr Bujak (22) 586 8341 Aleksander Krzyzaniak (22) 586 8342 (22) 586 8363 Email: imie.nazwisko@bzwbk.pl Daily News - an overview of events Marian Noga is the third most popular candidate among SLD senators ... which means that strong doves will not dominate the Council ... although we will see some cautious rate reductions this year from the Cracow Economic University, and Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner, the current deputy finance minister. Their candidacies are supported not only by the majority of senators, but also by the government and the President of Poland. Another candidate popular in leftist circles is Marian Noga. However, as a senator, he received a negative recommendation from the president. Nonetheless, it is worth remembering that the selection of MPC members is a sovereign decision of the Senate, to be made by secret ballot without imposed party discipline, so the outcome of the vote is still very uncertain. Assuming that the three mentioned above get the Senate's nomination, the group of radical doves will most likely fail to dominate the new MPC, as NBP Chairman Leszek Balcerowicz will be able to count on a coalition with three presidentially appointed members (names still unknown) and one or two Senate appointees (Wasilewska-Trenkner and perhaps Owsiak). If, in addition, one of the president's economic advisors is on the MPC in place of Noga, the risk of excessive monetary easing will actually be much lower than might have been feared until recently. Which does not change the fact that we will most likely still see cautious interest rate cuts this year. Conclusion: the choice of MPC members in the Senate is still uncertain, but it is likely that super doves will not dominate the new Council. Today's money supply data Acceleration of nominal growth rates of monetary aggregates is normal with rising inflation and economic recovery Today the December data releases will begin. The first to be released will be monetary statistics, published by the central bank at 4:00 p.m. We estimate that money supply growth remained unchanged at 5.6% y/y. As in November, we expect a significant decline in the ""other components of M3,"" mainly due to the expiration of bank bonds that households purchased a year ago to avoid capital gains tax. On the other hand, growth in household deposits and cash in circulation should accelerate (the latter will reach nearly 21% y/y in December). On the receivables side, the gradual recovery in loan demand is expected to continue (total loan growth of 8.7% y/y vs. 8.5% in November), driven primarily by rising loans to households. Overall, the data should not surprise, sustaining the trends seen in the previous month. The acceleration in growth of monetary aggregates is not surprising, given the rising inflation rate and reviving economic activity in Polish industry. Conclusion: today's data should be in line with investors' expectations and neutral for the market. Change in pension indexation postponed The government's decision means that the 2004 budget deficit will not be reduced by PLN 1.3-1.4 billion Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner said yesterday after a government meeting that there will be no change in the way pensions are indexed this year. He added, however, that the government has not abandoned plans to change this system, but has only postponed them until next year. Hausner said that this will not mean a reduction in the total amount of savings in public finances in the coming years. He believes that the planned amount of 32 billion zlotys must be achieved. 2 Daily Bulletin - an overview of events ... which is bad news for the long end of the yield curve Trade unions opposed to Hausner's plan The postponement of the indexation change means that the government's promise to make a reduction in this year's budget deficit (by PLN 1.4 billion) is becoming very implausible. Although Hausner said that savings must be found elsewhere, he gave no specifics. The deputy prime minister presented a timetable for further work on the public finance savings program. On January 20, the government will discuss possible modifications to the plan, and on January 27 it will be taken up by the SLD National Council. By the end of March, all laws related to the plan are expected to go to parliament. Today, the Hausner plan will be discussed by the Trilateral Commission, but it appears that the unions will reject the government's proposals. Conclusion: The change in the way social benefits are indexed has been postponed, which is the first failure in the implementation of the Hasner plan. Will it be the last failure? Controversial Senate debate on budget changes The Senate will vote today on the 2004 budget ...with a proposal to reduce transfers from special appropriations The zloty quotes (13.01.2004) Min Max USD 3.6720 3.7200 EUR 4.6890 4.7400 Fixing 3.6868 4.7053 Exchange rates (today's opening) EURUSD CADPLN 1.2736 USDPLN DKKPLN 3.7375 EURPLN NOKPLN 4,7599 CHFPLN SEKPLN 3.0519 JPYPLN* CZKPLN 3.5183 GBPPLN HUFPLN* 6.8955 * 100 units 2.9352 0.6390 0.5564 0.5199 0.1461 1.7755 Secondary market yields (13.Jan.2004) Bills Yield Change (bps) 3M 5.20 -5 6M 5.45 0 9M 5.45 0 12M 5.48 +18 Bonds Yield Change (bps) 2L 5.98 +7 3L 6.05 +5 4L 6.25 +5 5L 6.46 +11 8L 6.53 +8 10L 6.48 +8 20L 6.60 +10 WIBOR Rates (13.01.2004) Term Rates O/N 5.04 Y/N 5.21 SW 5.31 2W 5.34 1M 5.40 3M 5.41 6M 5.43 9M 5.46 1Y 5.46 Change (bps) -22 -15 -9 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -3 Yesterday, in addition to deliberating on candidates for the new MPC, senators also debated amendments to the 2004 budget bill. The discussion generated a lot of controversy, as there were a number of proposals changing the shape of the budget adopted by the Sejm in December. One of the proposals stipulated that ministries and various state institutions would have to transfer only 15% (rather than 40%) of their income collected in the form of so-called special funds to the budget. This is a solution strongly supported by the government, which argued that a transfer of 40% of the funds (passed by the Sejm) would in practice paralyze the functioning of some important state institutions. Reducing the level of the transfer to 15% would reduce budget revenues from this source in 2004 by PLN 1.1 billion, which would be tantamount to reducing the subsidy passed by the Sejm for local rail transportation and the construction of the Warsaw subway (to PLN 150 million from PLN 550 million and to PLN 50 million from PLN 150 million, respectively). Therefore, this was immediately met with a highly critical reaction from trade unions and some politicians. Although yesterday the majority of senators (and government representatives) supported the reduction of transfers from ""special funds,"" the Senate Speaker decided to postpone the vote on the budget bill until today to gain time for additional consultations on the issue. Conclusion: Controversy in the Senate over the reduction of transfers from ""special appropriations."" The decision has been postponed and is still uncertain. Market Monitor Market sentiment deteriorated yesterday and both the zloty and bonds weakened on supply mainly from foreign institutions. The worse sentiment was likely due to recurring concerns over the introduction of the Hausner plan. Today, 3-year WZ0307 and 7-year WZ0911 bonds with a total face value of PLN 1.5 billion will be offered at auction. Moderate demand is expected due to low interest in floating rate bonds from domestic and foreign banks. 3 Daily Review of Events Conclusion: Concerns about fiscal policy have weakened the market. International Review The European Commission has filed a lawsuit with the European Court of Justice against the Council of Ministers. In November, the Council decided not to penalize Germany and France for a third consecutive breach of the budget deficit criterion. Yesterday, the Commission declared the decision illegal on procedural grounds and sued the Council. According to preliminary estimates, French consumer prices rose 0.1% m/m in December, which translated into a slowdown in the annual inflation rate to 2.4% from the 2.5% recorded in November. The data was in line with market forecasts. Industrial production results were weaker than expected in November. In France, production declined by 0.4% m/m, while the forecast was for 0.1%. Today in the United States, data on producer prices in December will be published, as well as information on trade turnover in November. Market forecasts point to a 0.2% m/m increase in prices and a trade deficit of $42.0 billion. XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX"
9;15.01.2004;"Daily News Review Their Troika January 15, 2004 The Senate yesterday elected three members to the new MPC. As we expected, they became Marian Noga, Stanislaw Owsiak and Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner. This choice of senators means that the composition of the new Council will be balanced. Of course, the new MPC will be more ""dovish"" than the current composition. We still believe that cautious interest rate cuts should be expected in the first quarter of this year. The Senate also completed its work on the state budget for this year yesterday, making minor changes to the bill passed earlier by the Sejm. The budget deficit is still planned at PLN 45.3 billion. The money supply data published yesterday turned out to be in line with our forecasts and showed a continuation of the trend observed in the previous few months. From the MPC's point of view, they should be neutral. Also neutral for monetary policy should be the inflation data published today. We expect CPI at the end of 2003 to be 1.7% y/y. In addition, today there will be a press conference by Finance Minister Andrzej Raczka, which will focus on the budget and the economy in 2003. Hot news Senate elects MPC members The Senate has elected three members of the new Monetary Policy Council Results of the election of MPC members in the Senate Candidate Number of votes Noga 64 Wasilewska-Trenkner 63 Owsiak 61 Chojna-Duch 20 Wojtyna 11 Kuczynski 10 Pietrzak 8 Krajewski 4 Note: Absolute majority: 46 Source: Senate The new MPC will be more ""dovish"" than the previous one, but not radical The three new members appointed to the Monetary Policy Council by the Senate are: Halina Wasilewska-Trenkner (deputy finance minister), Marian Noga (SLD senator, rector of the Wrocław University of Economics) and Stanisław Owsiak (professor at the Cracow University of Economics). Thus, the result of the vote (presented in detail in the table in the margin) fully confirmed our expectations, which we wrote about yesterday. This is undoubtedly positive news for the Polish economy and the financial market, as the most pessimistic scenario of the new MPC being dominated by people with radical, strongly ""dovish"" views did not materialize. Recall that the three people elected yesterday will join the three appointed by the Sejm last week: Jan Czekaj, Stanislaw Nieckarz and Miroslaw Pietrewicz. We still don't officially know the names of President Kwasniewski's candidates (they are expected to be announced in early February), but we can bet that Professors Edmund Pietrzak and Andrzej Wojtyna will be among them. There is more uncertainty surrounding the third presidential nominee. However, in our opinion, it could be someone from the central bank with experience in monetary policy and the functioning of financial markets. We are betting that this candidate could be Andrzej Slawinski, a professor at the Warsaw School of Economics and a long-time NBP employee. Although some names are still uncertain, it can be concluded that the composition of the new MPC will be quite balanced. Of course, we maintain our opinion that the new Council, on average, will be more dovish than the previous one. However, most of the MPC members are likely to be Maciej Reluga Chief Economist Piotr Bielski (22) 586 8333 Piotr Bujak (22) 586 8341 Aleksander Krzyzaniak (22) 586 8342 (22) 586 8363 Email: imie.nazwisko@bzwbk.pl Daily Review of Events Expect cautious rate cuts in the first half of the year presented a balanced and pragmatic approach to monetary policy, which should result in prudent decisions on interest rates and the exchange rate. We still expect the MPC to return to interest rate cuts and continue its ""small steps"" strategy. Almost all newly elected Council members have indicated in their statements that there is still room for a cautious interest rate cut. The first reduction of 25 bps can still be expected in the first quarter of this year, most likely in March. Meanwhile, the reference rate should fall to 4.5% by the end of the first half of the year. Conclusion: the election of MPC members in the Senate showed that this time rational arguments prevailed over party interests. We can still expect cautious rate cuts in H1 2004. Money supply growth in line with expectations % y/y M3, liabilities and receivables 35 30 25 20 15 M3 Receivables 10 Liabilities 5 -10 01/03 01/02 01/01 01/00 01/99 -5 01/98 0 Total money supply (M3) increased by 1% m/m and 5.5% y/y in December, almost in line with our forecast (5.6% y/y). Typically seasonal growth was recorded in household and corporate deposits, up 0.9% m/m and 7.3% m/m, respectively. Importantly, the improvement in the annual growth rate continued for household deposits, which amounted to -2% in December vs. -3.4% in November approx. -7% in mid-2002. Meanwhile, growth in corporate deposits and cash money stabilized after accelerating rapidly in previous months, reaching 24% y/y and 17.1% y/y, respectively. Total receivables of the entire banking system grew at a similar pace to November (8.6% y/y vs. 8.5% y/y a month ago), and this was achieved thanks to a slight acceleration in the growth of loans to households (14.1% y/y vs. 13.6% in November) with slightly lower growth in loans to businesses (2.7% y/y after 3.6% y/y a month earlier). All in all, the data did not bring much new to the picture of the current economic situation. Therefore, they should be neutral for the MPC and the financial market. Conclusion: money supply growth in line with expectations, neutral for the market. The Senate passed the 2004 budget. Slight changes by the Senate in the 2004 budget. Final adoption of the budget bill next week Yesterday, the Senate passed the 2004 budget bill with some amendments compared to the version passed by the Diet. As expected, the senators reduced the amount of special funds transferred to the budget by ministries and other institutions from 40% (set by the Sejm) to 15% (proposed by Minister Hausner). This triggered a reduction in this year's subsidy for the construction of the Warsaw subway once regional rail transportation. However, the Senate did not support the government's request to reduce the deficit by an additional PLN 100 million, and the planned shortfall remained at PLN 45.3 million. The PLN 100 million was diverted to the NFZ. The bill will now return to the Sejm, which will vote on the Senate's amendments. Final parliamentary passage is scheduled for the January 20-23 session. Conclusion: minor adjustments to this year's budget in the Senate. 2 Daily News - overview of events Today's inflation data At 4 pm, the Central Statistical Office (CSO) will release inflation data ... expected to rise to 1.7% y/y Today at 4 pm, the CSO will release information on the growth of consumer prices in December. Following the release of preliminary data on a moderate increase in food prices in December (about 0.3% m/m), we estimate that the CPI inflation rate rose slightly to 1.7% y/y from 1.6% y/y in November (our expectations are in line with the market consensus). This will be mainly due to the negative impact of a low statistical base for alcohol and fuel prices, which declined in December 2002, while they probably recorded slight increases in December 2003. Prices of other goods and services should remain almost stable. The data will be neutral for the market and for the outlook for monetary policy. Conclusion: inflation at the end of 2003 is expected to be 1.7% y/y. Such a result will be neutral for the market and from the point of view of monetary policy. 2003 budget data today.

Recent statements by Deputy Finance Minister Halina WasilewskaTrenkner indicate that the data will be quite positive, showing that the deficit was slightly lower throughout the year than the planned PLN 38.7 billion. It should be remembered, however, that although the central budget deficit came within the target amount, the deficit of the entire public finance sector and the public debt were higher than expected in 2003, as a large part of budget spending was ""pushed"" outside the central budget. Change (bps) +8 +2 +4 +1 0 +4 +8 +11 +14 surprise. The deterioration in Polish market sentiment continued yesterday. In addition to concerns about the introduction of the Hausner program, there was speculation about Minister Hausner's resignation, and hence both the zloty and bonds saw significant weakening. The EURPLN exchange rate exceeded the level of 4.75. Yesterday, the first ever auction of 3-year WZ0307 and 7-year WZ0911 bonds took place. Bonds with shorter maturities attracted more interest from investors. Total reported demand was higher than total supply, but the ministry sold fewer bonds than were offered. Conclusion: uncertainty has returned to the market and is likely to remain there for some time. International Review Producer price data in the United States roughly matched the market's forecast. Prices posted a 0.3% m/m increase in December, following a 0.3% m/m decline in November. Market expectations for December were at 0.2%. The annual growth rate of producer inflation accelerated to 4.0% from the 3.4% recorded in November. The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in 3 Daily Review November to $38.0 billion from $41.6 billion recorded in October. The deficit was significantly lower than the $42.0 billion forecast. Today, the United States is scheduled to release inflation and retail sales data for December. Market forecasts point to an increase of 0.2% m/m in consumer prices and 0.4% m/m in sales. The Eurozone will see the second publication of economic growth data for the third quarter of 2003. Analysts expect confirmation of earlier estimates of GDP growth of 0.4% q/q and 0.3% y/y. In Italy, final inflation estimates for December will be reported. XXXXX DISCLAIMER XXXX"
